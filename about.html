            <p>The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has outlined an unprecedented situation in most countries,
                especially in so-called global cities, hence posing increased challenges to crime prevention strategies
                and the criminal justice systems across the world. This study will undertake an intensive comparative
                study, using 4 selected global financial centres **Hong Kong, London, Sydney and New York**, on the
                variations in trends for different types of crime, in the spatio-temporal patterns of crime, to bring
                forward succinct suggestions on crime prevention strategies against the pandemic in global cities.</p>
            <p>The project aims to address the following three questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>how have the type and number of crimes been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak?</li>
                <li>Have some urban areas been disproportionately affected by crime in this period?</li>
                <li>How are trends in crime likely to develop in the future?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Taking into consideration the variations among cities, the work will examine the impact of COVID-19 on
                crime in global cities, to make an appropriate justification on whether a change in mobility within the
                city affects the nature and levels of crime, and how we further factor in alterations in peopleâ€™s
                habits, such as shopping, socialising, remote working and the reduction in the use of public
                transportation. The project will develop predictive models on those key features affected by the
                pandemic, to envisage what the future crime demand for cities.</p>
